# Inheritance

In this piece of work i was tasked with using inheritence to create a game and also a tiered package calculator. I found this assignment very beneficial as it
helped me learn how to best use inheritence in the future.

## How to use
To run my project simply 'clone' the repository and then compile all of the files. Once compiled you can run 'java Game' or 'java AccountUser'.
